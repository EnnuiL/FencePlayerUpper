# Fence Player Upper

A very simple mod that allows players to jump on walls and fences. The blocks which can be jumped over can be determinated by the `fenceplayerupper:boost_jump` block tag. This mod requires the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and doesn't need to be installed in the client (unless it's singleplayer).
